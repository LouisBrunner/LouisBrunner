### Hi, my name is Louis

In 2008, I started learning programming, for free, from a website made by volunteers. Software Engineering quickly became my hobby and then my job.

Since 2015 (after my studies were wrapping up and I had a bit more time on my hand), I have been contributing to various projects I use, fixing bugs, adding features I need, improving documentation... I have always wanted to give back to the community (and the world at large) and repay what I received for free all these years ago by making software more Free and Open.

I have more than a decade of experience through which I learned a very versatile and technology agnostic skillset, having worked with many different languages and stacks (C, C++, Golang, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Terraform, Java, etc etc), in various industries (robotics, IoT, web agencies, compilers & development tools, DevOps, consulting and more).

[**Calyptia**](https://github.com/calyptia) is supporting development for M1 support on [valgrind-macos](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/valgrind-macos), thanks!

## My work

I currently focusing most of my time on: 

 * [valgrind-macos](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/valgrind-macos) ![brew](https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-22k%2Fyear-green): Valgrind's official macOS port is severly outdated so I started maintaining my own fork for simplicity of development. Most of my work focus on resolving breakages linked to new macOS versions but also improving the port as a whole to make Valgrind more useful on macOS. According to [brew analytics](https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/install/365d/), [valgrind-macos](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/valgrind-macos) gets around 22k downloads per month.
 * [dnd-multi-backend](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/dnd-multi-backend) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/dnd-multi-backend)/![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-dnd-preview): This monorepo contains a set of NPM packages dealing with drag-n-drop, especially with React. They are all based on the [React-DnD](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd) framework.
 * [checks-action](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/checks-action): a GitHub Action used to manipulate the GitHub Checks API directly from your YAML workflow, including adding annotations on files, matching the outcome of the job, etc. According to [GitHub](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/checks-action/network/dependents), this action is used by more than 600 other repositories, including [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) or even [NPM](https://github.com/npm/cli).
 * Some various smaller packages like [diff-action](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/diff-action) (GitHub Action to make diffs and publish them as GitHub Checks with automatic regression testing) or [avahi2dns](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/avahi2dns) (a tiny DNS server which can be used to query local mDNS records through Avahi, useful to bridge musl's lack of mDNS support)

Here is some examples of projects I have contributed to in the past (mostly small fixes):

 * [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) (JavaScript): contributed a way to import NURBS stored in FBX files and a small improvement to `LineMaterial`
 * [gping](https://github.com/orf/gping) (Python): improved resizing behaviour, including fixing crashes
 * [pi-hole](https://github.com/arevindh/pi-hole) (Shellscript): fixed a crontab-related crash
 * [sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon) (and its related [fake-timers](https://github.com/sinonjs/fake-timers)) (JavaScript): various small improvements
 * [lua-intf](https://github.com/SteveKChiu/lua-intf) (C++): added support for Lua 5.4
 * [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) (Go): improved support for generics
 * [go-ykpiv](https://github.com/go-piv/go-ykpiv) (Go): fix compilation for ARM architecture
 * [atom's tree-view](https://github.com/atom/tree-view) (CoffeeScript): improved trash bin handling on Linux
 * [terraform-provider-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/terraform-provider-auth0) (Go): fixed a crash when passing `null` in Terraform
 * [swftools](https://github.com/matthiaskramm/swftools) (C): improved support for some fonts
 * [mdn](https://github.com/mdn/content) (Markdown): fixed a typo in a link (ðŸ˜‚)
